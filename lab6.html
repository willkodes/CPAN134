            <h2>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile</h2>
            <p>
                I started this web site because Halloween has always been my favourite holiday. 
                But during the last year, I started selling some of my favourite Halloween products,
                and they've become quite a hit.
                <br><br>
                If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favourite Halloween pictures, stories, and films.
                And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
            </p>
